# gui-based-student-portal
I developed a Simple Student Portal using JavaSwing 🎉 , which allows students to log in, view profiles, check fee clearance status, view results, and access the course dashboard.  Gui is basic, mostly JOptionPane Class is used 

Functionalities: 
✔️Log in with their credentials.
✔️View their profile, fee status, and results.
✔️You can access a dashboard with course information.
✔️All data is stored in a text file, making it simple yet functional!
